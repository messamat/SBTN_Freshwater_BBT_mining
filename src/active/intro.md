# Introduction 
## Basin Threshold Tool: data mining protocol
### Science-based targets for Nature: Freshwater

This book documents the information mining protocol underlying the Basin Threshold Tool (BTT) as part of the Science-based targets for Nature: Freshwater. The BTT is a global data repository of local-level surface water and groundwater quantity and quality data, environmental flow (e-flow) knowledge, and associated models, methods, and tools, designed in alignment with global frameworks, and is an important contribution to curbing the global decline in freshwater biodiversity. 

## Aims and scope of the information mining protocol
### Objective
Identify sources of information and extract data on the following topics in specific hydrologic basins:
- Monitoring data and models on surface water and groundwater quantity (flows and levels)
- Environmental flows assessments, models, and implementations for surface water and groundwater quantity
- Flow-ecology relationships linking hydrological regime components and river flow alterations to ecological responses
- Monitoring data, models, and standards/thresholds on surface water quality

### Main output 
Database of surface water and groundwater quantity and quality data and e-flows for specific hydrologic basins for use by companies to set targets.
